# Daily Creative Developer Practice

This repository contains my **daily 1–2 hour learning routine** to improve my skills as a creative developer, combining frontend engineering expertise with design and artistic creativity.

## 📅 Structure

Each folder represents a day of practice, containing the exercises, notes, or projects I’ve worked on.

Example structure:
```
/Day-01
  ├── task.md
  ├── code/
  └── assets/
```

## 🎯 Goals

- Strengthen **frontend fundamentals** (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React)
- Improve **UI/UX design skills**
- Learn and practice **creative coding** (Three.js, GSAP, animations)
- Build a **strong creative portfolio**
